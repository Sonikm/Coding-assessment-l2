# Coding Assessment L-2 Code Submission 

## Product Details Page Interaction
This project demonstrates how to create an interactive product details page for an e-commerce website. The page allows users to view product images, select colors and sizes, adjust quantities, and add items to their cart.

The JavaScript code fetches product data from a JSON file and populates the page with the product information. Event listeners are used to handle interactions such as changing thumbnails, selecting colors and sizes, updating quantities, and displaying an "Added to Cart" message.
